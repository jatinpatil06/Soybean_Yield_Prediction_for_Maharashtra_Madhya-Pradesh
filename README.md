# üåæ Soybean Yield Prediction using Machine Learning in Maharashtra & Madhya Pradesh

This repository contains the implementation of a robust machine learning pipeline for predicting soybean yield across two major agricultural states in India: **Maharashtra** and **Madhya Pradesh**. The project integrates **geospatial, soil, and meteorological data**, applying state-of-the-art regression models and explainability tools to support **precision agriculture** and **policy-level decision making**.

## üìö Abstract

Agricultural uncertainty remains a persistent issue in India, especially in soybean-producing states where unstable crop yields have led to **financial stress** and **farmer suicides**. This project proposes a **data-driven framework** to forecast soybean yields using:
- Meteorological data
- Soil nutrient features
- Machine learning models
- Explainability techniques

To combat **data sparsity** and **imbalanced yield distributions**, we use **SMOGN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Regression with Gaussian Noise)**. The pipeline evaluates multiple regressors, and the **Extra Trees Regressor** emerged as the best performer with:

> **R¬≤ = 0.81 | MAE = 150.4**

Further, explainable AI techniques like **LIME** and **SHAP** were integrated to reveal that:
- **Nitrogen & Phosphorus levels**
- **Temperature range**
- **Wind speed**

are the most influential factors in determining yield.

## üß† Explainable AI

To improve model transparency and build user trust:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Quantified global feature contributions.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: Explained individual predictions.

These tools confirmed **soil nutrients and climatic factors** as key yield predictors.
